I put some prepackaged tarballs in Downloads page because of storage limitation for free account in github.com . Those tarballs are packages of source code from project Moses core and other upstream projects(GIZA++, language model). They are released under their own license. Put them here just for convenient to build rpm packages.

The patch files and Spec files are released under license LGPL.
